# Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes, which store data, and edges, which represent relationships or connections between nodes.
- a collection of nodes + connections between nodes
- consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points
- together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph
